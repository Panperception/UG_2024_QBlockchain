# Quantum-Blockchain
A quantum blockchain implemented using Grover's algorithm and BB84 quantum key distribution scheme
Please install Qiskit before running the program, pip install qiskit
To run themain quantum blockchain, use python qblockchainBB84.
If you need to run the circuit on real quantum machine, remember to change the API key in line 9 of qblockchainBB84.py and qblockchainB92.py
You can get the API key after registering an account on https://quantum.ibm.com/

You can also change the quantum computer server based on the current workload of the server on line 12 of qblockchainBB84.py and qblockchainB92.py.
Sometimes it is normal that the query need to wait for 3-4 hours before finish queueing.
